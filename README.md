# Tech4Dev Month 2 Week 4 Assignment  

This assignment involves using Terraform to provision the infrastructure for our **core banking application** on **AWS**.  

## **Infrastructure Components**  
The following resources will be created:  

- **25 Virtual Machines (VMs)**  
- **Load Balancer** (for traffic distribution)  
- **Block Storage Allocation** (EBS volumes)  
- **Relational Database** (RDS)  
- **Route 53** (DNS for `corebank.com`, pointing to the load balancer)  
- **ElastiCache** (for caching)  
- **VPC, Subnets, and Route Tables** (networking)  
- **Security Groups** (to control access)  

## **Deployment**  
This infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform, ensuring automated and scalable deployment on AWS.
